              <p class="five">I am a young girl aged 21 , And  I am passionate about <em> Programming.</em>
              I have an A2 degree in (Mathematics,Pysics and Computer Science), and i am now a student in AUCA(Adventist University of Central Africa) in Level two.
        So, At first i wasn't planning to do pragramming . It was even i my dreams . i wanted to study Medecine and become a doctor, but in life we don't only get what we want.so, it didn't work.
        that is how i joined IT courses . At the begining it was very hard for me and i would think of dropping school. bu quite after a certain periodof time i started falling in love with the output i was getting.
        Now i love programming so much and it is one of my hobbies. <p>
